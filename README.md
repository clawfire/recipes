# Recipes

Sometimes being a ratlab coder is not all in life. Sometimes you enjoy a hot and nice meal, and love sharing with others.

So let's start making some easy, (hope to be) healthy and delicious cooking.

The original recipes are in **french** but you are so welcome to make translation.

## FAQ

**1. I don't speak french ! help me**

I'm so sorry but French is my main language so those recipes are in french too. But I can help you to translate it in English if Google Translate don't know how to help you and there's no previously translated version available.


**2. I understand french, I wanna contribute to translating**
