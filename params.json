Sometimes you enjoy a hot and nice meal, and love sharing with others.\r\n\r\nSo let's start making some easy, (hope to be) healthy and delicious cooking.\r\n\r\nThe original recipes are in **french** but you are so welcome to make translation.\r\n\r\n## Format\r\n\r\nWhen I start with this idea I fugure myself sharing PDF files. But where's the community, where's the community spirit with a close file format like PDF ? It's too static. So I consider rtf or txt files too but I miss the inter-operatibility.\r\n\r\nSo what ?\r\n\r\n**V-RECIPE-CARD !** It's a normalise format, mimic the VCARD format and it's built in my recipe software. I didn't found any RFC online or scheme but I hope the editor soon answer me in this topic.\r\n\r\n## FAQ\r\n\r\n**1. I don't speak french ! help me**\r\n\r\nI'm so sorry but French is my main language so those recipes are in french too. But I can help you to translate it in English if Google Translate don't know how to help you and there's no previously translated version available.\r\n\r\n\r\n**2. I understand french, I wanna contribute to translating**\r\n\r\n- Fork this repo\r\n- Make a sub-folder with [your locale](http://www.iana.org/assignments/language-subtag-registry) and respect the original name for the filename.\r\n- Send me a push request ;)\r\n","google":""}
